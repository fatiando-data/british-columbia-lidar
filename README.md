# British Columbia, Canada - Lidar point cloud

This is a point cloud sliced to the small
[Trail Islands](https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/21973.html) to the
North of Vancouver to reduce the data size.
The islands have some nice looking topography and their isolated nature creates
problems for some interpolation methods, like simple nearest-neighbors.

## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Cut out a section of the original data to focus only on these small islands.
* Change UTM coordinates to geodetic latitude and longitude (WGS84).
* Keep only the ground reflection picks.
* Export to a compressed CSV for easier loading with Pandas.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
